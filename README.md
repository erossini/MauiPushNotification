# MauiPushNotification
It is more than 2 weeks since I tried to configure and implement in my [NET8](https://puresourcecode.com/?s=net8) [MAUI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77930377/net-8-maui-and-azure-notification-hub-configuration-is-not-working) application the push notifications using [Azure Notification Hubs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77930377/net-8-maui-and-azure-notification-hub-configuration-is-not-working). Also, I paid the [Azure](https://puresourcecode.com/dotnet/azure/azure-treasures-in-the-cloud/) support (not very useful), and I still can’t configure the hub for Windows and Android. So, I tried another plugin at this point but had to ignore the Windows notification (sigh!).

So, I show you everything I discovered without using external plugin but only what MAUI offers and `HttpClient`. I split this topic in a few posts:
*   [MAUI Push Notifications using Azure Notification Hub](https://puresourcecode.com/dotnet/maui/maui-push-notifications-using-azure-notification-hub/)
*   [MAUI Push Notifications using Azure Notification Hub for Android](https://puresourcecode.com/dotnet/maui/maui-push-notifications-using-azure-notification-hub-for-android/)
